We were looking at the stars when gravity took hold of us
I never thought we'd fall so hard, I never had the warning
Racing at the speed of sound, flying over dead end streets
There's nothing here to slow us down, now I know we're ready

(Pre-)
And as we fall into the skies, safer than a parachute
One heart that beats without align(?!), through and through(?!)
Racing at the speed of sound, stealing lights from paradise
There's nothing here to slow us down, now I know we're ready

Cuz we can't stop this now, oh, no
We shouldn't fight it, let it go
We're sailing alone tonight on the ocean
We're sailing alone tonight to reach the shore
Sailing alone tonight, the world _______(?)
I wanna hold you forever, like a lover wanna do in a photograph

(Repeat Pre-)
