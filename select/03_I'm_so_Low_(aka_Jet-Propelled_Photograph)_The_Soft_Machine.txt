How far can anyone go and to where,
How much can anyone do and to who,
Oh, oh, oh girl,
I'm so low girl,
What can I do?
I believe in you.
How far can anyone go and to where,
How much can anyone do and to who,
Oh, oh, oh girl,
I'm so low girl,
Take a look around,
What's that you've found.
There'll come a time when you won't understand the position of,
Someone you tried and decided to gain acquisition of.
How far can anyone go and to where,
How much can anyone do and to who,
Oh, oh, oh girl,
I'm so low girl,
What can I do?
I believe in you.
