Pretty darling stop running down my street
The tears are dropping like a nuclear meltdown
I never meant to let it come to this
Can we blame it on timing not chemistry?

All night long, I'll sing the same somber song
Attack my decisions and the horse they rode on
Everything seems to be less than zero
A mascara hero with a heart of zinc

I never should've kissed
I never should've

And I never should've kissed those lips before
I never should've let you out my door
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph

The words you chant, I never thought they'd
Be so true, dancing in my head
So pause this moment till we meet in our next life
A black tabby house cat, a bottle of Xanax

All night long is one repeated love song
When have I became this tree
Till we meet in our brand new world
I'll count the rings if you tie a string

I never should've kissed
I never should've

And I never should've kissed those lips before
I never should've let you out my door
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph
Alright

And I never should've kissed those lips before
I never should've let you out my door
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph

And I never should've kissed those lips before
I never should've let you out my door
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph

And I never should've kissed those lips before
I never should've let you out my door
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph
Alright
