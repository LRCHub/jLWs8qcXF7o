This is not a photograph - no
(This is not a photograph)
And these are not the Elysian Fields
(This is not a photograph)
This is not a bigot's head, no
(This is not a photograph)
(This is not a photograph)

This is just a perpendicular line to the grain
(This is not a photograph)
This wants to be outside the cage of the age
(This is not a photograph)
This is not a bigot's leg
(This is not a photograph)
(This is not a photograph)

(This is not a photograph)
(This is not a photograph)
