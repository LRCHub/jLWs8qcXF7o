I have walked these miles of city streets
My head is filled with memories of before
Before
And the neon lights are flickering
Out of every bar I've ever been
Before
Before

Time to walk away
Time to walk away

Say goodbye to who I used to be
That ain't me
That ain't me
Say goodbye to the games that I played
I'm not the same
I'm not the same as before
Say goodbye to who I used to be
That ain't me
That ain't me no more

These roads I walked are crumbling
And I'm lose inside of everything
That I've done
That I've done
They said this place was made to last
But it's faded like a photograph
In the sun
In the sun

Time to walk away
Time to walk away

Say goodbye to who I used to be
That ain't me
That ain't me
Say goodbye to the games that I played
I'm not the same
I'm not the same as before
Say goodbye to who I used to be
That ain't me
That ain't me no more

Say goodbye to who I used to be
That ain't me
That ain't me
Say goodbye to the games that I played
I'm not the same
I'm not the same as before
Say goodbye to who I used to be
That ain't me
That ain't me no more
